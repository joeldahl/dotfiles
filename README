My collection of dotfiles.

I've only tried them on FreeBSD and OSX (which are my main development
platforms) but they should probably work on Linux too.

All color settings (vim themes, for example) have been developed with my
.Xdefaults colors in mind, so if you're going to use any of these dotfiles
make sure you also download the .Xdefaults file (at least if you want the
color theme I originially intended).

As usual, use at your own risk and all that.  :-)
