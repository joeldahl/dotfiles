My collection of dotfiles.

I've only tried them on FreeBSD and OSX (my main development platforms) but
they should probably work on Linux too.

I prefer to work with simple-yet-powerful text-based tools and I've spent
quite a few hours creating an development environment that I feel comfortable
with (tcsh, tmux, vim, mutt, xterm, irssi).  These dotfiles are the result.

All color settings (vim themes, for example) have been developed with my
.Xdefaults colors in mind, so if you're going to use any of these dotfiles
make sure you also download the .Xdefaults file (at least if you want the
color theme I originally intended).

As usual, use at your own risk and all that.  :-)
