# My collection of dotfiles.

I prefer to work with simple yet powerful text-based tools and I've spent
quite a few hours creating an development environment that I feel comfortable
with (tcsh, vim, tmux, mutt, xterm, irssi).  These dotfiles are the result.

All color settings (vim themes, for example) have been developed with my
.Xdefaults colors in mind, so if you're going to use any of these dotfiles
make sure you also download the .Xdefaults file (at least if you want the
color theme I originally intended).

Mostly tested on FreeBSD. Use at your own risk.  :-)
