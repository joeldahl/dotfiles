# My collection of dotfiles.

I prefer to work with text-based tools and I've spent quite a few hours
creating a development environment that I feel comfortable with. These
dotfiles are the result.

All color settings (vim themes, for example) have been developed with my
Xdefaults/iTerm2 colors in mind, so if you're going to use any of these
dotfiles make sure you also download the .Xdefaults file (at least if you
want the color theme I originally intended).

Tested on FreeBSD and OSX. Use at your own risk.  :-)
